--1. What are all possible values of a Boolean expression?
TRUE, FALSE

--2. List eight Boolean operators.
==, !=, <, <=, >, >=, !, &&

--3. What is the general concept of short circuiting? This question has a short and simple answer and you
--do not need to have a detailed response.
if the left operand evaluates to false/true, the entire expression is false/true

--4. What are the difference in how short circuiting works for && and ||?
&& evaluates false when the left expression is false, but the || expression will evaluate the entire statement to true when the left expression is true
&&operator has a higher precedence than ||

--5. Look at the list of operators. What operator has the highest precedence? Which has the lowest?
() has precedence override, = has the lowest precedence

--6. In an if or else construction using multiple lines of code, what effect does the use of curly braces have?
starts a new scope with the if/else constructions lines of code, allowing to define variables in the block without
interfering with other statements outside of the construction. without the braces, the compiler will only associate the
first statement with the if/else construction.

--7. In a switch statement, what happens if you omit break?
the execution will fall through to the next lable and cause bugs that are hard to find
without break theres no way to escape the switch statement

--8. (Not in book) What is a recursive method? Using a language you know (such as English), write a
--recursive method that adds up the integers in a list of integers. The input to the method is a list of
--integers and the output is a scalar value representing a sum.
a recursive method is a method that calls itself. that is its a block of statements that repeat until a criteria is met
in english, a recursive method would sound something like: if a=10, stop. if it doesnt equal 10, add 1. and repeat until a=10.
in C# it would look more like below


using System;    
    
namespace InterviewQuestionPart4    
{    
    class Program    
    {    
        static void Main(string[] args)    
        {    
            Console.WriteLine("Please Enter a Number");    
    
            //read number from user    
            int number =Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());    
    
            //invoke the static method    
            double factorial = Factorial(number);    
    
            //print the factorial result    
            Console.WriteLine("factorial of"+number+"="+factorial.ToString());    
    
        }    
        public static double Factorial(int number)    
        {    
            if (number == 0)    
                return 1;    
            return number * Factorial(number-1);//Recursive call    
    
        }    
    }    
}
