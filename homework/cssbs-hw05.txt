--1. What is a compound assignment operator? How does it work?
it is a shorthand command C# recognizes as arithmetic operators and uses to perform functions
instead of writing [variable = variable * number;] you would write [variable *= number;]

--2. List all the compound assignment operators.
variable *= number;
variable /= number;
variable %= number;
variable += number;
variable -= number;

--3. List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5. List two ways to decrement a numeric variable by 50.
variable = variable + 5; OR 5 += variable;
variable = variable - 50; OR 50 -= variable;
pg 116. count += 1; OR count++; (examples for count dont explain multiple number increments)

--4. How long does a while loop run?
the while loop runs untils the expression becomes false

--5. What happens if you donâ€™t change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block?
the program will loop the statement forever or until it runs out of memory

--6. How many parts does a for loop statement have? Can you omit any of them? Can you omit all of
--them? What happens if you omit all of them?
Pg 122. 3 parts. any of them can be omitted legally, but omitting the boolean expression causes the statement to loop forever.
if you omit them all you dont have a for loop statement anymore?

--7. How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?
by creating a do statement

--8. What does the break statement do?
it exits the loop immediately, execution continues at the first statement after the loop

--9. What does the continue statement do?
the continue statement starts the loop over again immediately.
